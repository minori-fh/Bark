## Description of Site
"Bark" is a social media app for individuals looking to connect with other individuals in their area. The app is based on the location of the user and allows users to make posts and see a history of their posts on his/ her profile page. 

The app was created for:

This site was deployed using Heroku with the JawsDB add-on. Our repo is based on a MVC (models views controllers) framework for easier maintenance and future scalability.
